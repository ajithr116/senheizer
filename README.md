### MERN E-Commerce Project

Welcome to my first MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) project, an e-commerce platform hosted at [senheizer.xyz](https://www.senheizer.xyz). This project aims to provide a fully functioning e-commerce experience, similar to other popular platforms.

#### Technologies Used:
- **MongoDB**: Used as the database for storing product information, user data, and order details.
- **Express.js**: Utilized for building the server-side application, handling routes, and interacting with the database.
- **React**: Employed for building the front-end user interface, providing a seamless and responsive experience.
- **Node.js**: Used as the server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for structuring and styling the web pages.
- **Bootstrap**: Utilized for creating a visually appealing and responsive design.

#### Key Features:
- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts securely.
- **Product Management**: Admins can add, edit, and delete products, including images and descriptions.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add products to their cart, update quantities, and proceed to checkout.
- **Order Management**: Users can view their order history and track the status of their orders.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to provide a seamless experience across various devices.
